### Briefly About Myself:

In college, I studied mechatronics, mobile robotics, microprocessor architecture, and basic C programming. I entered the WordSkills competition in the robotics category. During training, I got a job in the center of additional education, where he taught children the basics of electronics and robotics.

Some time ago I became interested in Frontend Development, I studied the basics of HTML, CSS and JavaScript on my own.
I believe, that diligence and the ability to learn will help me streamline my knowledge and gain new ones.
